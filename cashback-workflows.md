# Cashback Workflow

In the first section, I try to convince you why you should be doing these things, if you're already convinced, go straight to [the workflows](#cab-rides)

I'm lazy. I don't like to spend too much time doing repetitive manual things. What I do like is saving money.

If you're like me, what you want is to automate the process of saving money on small purchases and spend as little time as possible on finding deals for the slightly bigger but regular ones.

Time and money are both fungible. What that means is that if you use time for one task, you have that much less time for some other task. Eg. If you spend time watching Netflix, you have that much less time to go running or any other activity. The same is with money. So if you spend $100 on something normally but it could be $90, leaving you with $10 free for anything else, with no extra effort, you should totally do it, right? Right? Great!

I've used coupons and apps like Ibotta but the work was a little more than I would have liked. These are the apps that have given me best results with minimal effort.

My thought process in compiling this is to achieve these goals:

* Leave no money on the table
* Do not put in more effort than what you normally would
* Get real money and not locked in discounts / gift card that most people won't regularly use (eg. airline miles, store credit etc.)

In a lot of cases, the initial referral bonus itself is worth spending the little time registering on an app. The rest is savings on autopilot. :)

So here are my workflows for common purchases:
## Cab rides

### App

Freebird - Link your Uber account and card that you use on Uber to the app. You get 250 points ($0.50) per cab ride.

[Referral Link](https://my.fbird.co/JVXnI7eA1W) Use referral code: xf853. Use promo code GO2TEN (use this after referral) to get an additional $10 cashback on your first 2 rides. | [Non-ref](https://getpei.com/)

### Workflow

Book the cab via Freebird instead of Uber. That's all! No other steps needed.

### Cashing out

You can deposit money to your bank account from the app.

## Groceries

### Apps

* Raise - If you shop regularly at Walmart or Target, pay using a gift card. You can get up to 2% discount on gift cards on Raise. Referral bonus of $5 on your first gift card purchase. [Referral Link](https://www.raise.com/raise-rewards/DPRABHU8636) | [Non-ref](https://www.raise.com/)
* Ebates (aka Rakuten Rewards) - Register on Ebates and add the Ebates extension to your browser. This is a one-time action. Every time you visit a website (like Raise) on which Ebates has an offer, you will see a notification to activate cashback (1% on Raise). Simply click on it and you're good to go. Referral bonus of $10 on your first purchase via Ebates. [Referral Link](https://www.ebates.com/r/SPLASH794?eeid=28187) | [Non-ref](https://www.ebates.com/)


### Workflow 

Once you have everything set up, the workflow would be:

* Go to Raise.com
* Click on the Ebates "activate cashback" notification
* Buy a gift card
* Shop as you normally would
* Redeem the gift card while checking out

The first 3 steps can be completed in less than a minute. If you have cashback on your credit card, you just saved upto 7% in total with little extra effort.

### Cashing out

* Raise - direct discount on gift cards and bank deposit / PayPal
* Ebates - sends you a check every 3 months worth your cashback earnings (minimum of $5)

## Eating out

### Apps

Pei -  Link your card which you use for paying at restaurants and let it accumulate cashback. Pei has thousands of merchant partners that offer a variety of cashback amounts on purchases. Eg. CVS and Starbucks have 1%, Dominos 1.5%. If there's a national chain of restaurants, it's probably on Pei.

Referral bonus of $15 for linking your card and making your first purchase at a partner merchant. [Referral Link](https://getpei.onelink.me/l5ED/InAppReferral) Use code: p7u67n | [Non-ref](https://getpei.com/)

There are other apps like Dosh and Drop which are similar but I've found Pei to have the largest collection of merchants, the most generous offers and the easiest to cash out.

### Workflow

Just link your card and eat out as you normally would. Pei will add points to your account based on your spending.

### Cashing out

You can cash out to PayPal or Bitcoin (Minimum $15)

## Investing

### Apps

Acorns - Link your card to Acorns. It will track your spending, round off every purchase to the nearest $ amount and invest that change in a portfolio of equity or bonds. Install the "Found Money" extension (similar to Ebates) to get the cash back invested to your Acorns account
Referral bonus of $5 when you sign up and make an initial deposit of $5. [Referral Link](https://www.acorns.com/invite/J26NTQ) | [Non-ref](https://www.acorns.com/)

IMPORTANT: Acorns is a PAID service and costs $1 per month till your portfolio value reaches $5000. Then it's 0.25% / month. It is FREE for a student. So register with your university email ID to incur no fees!

### Workflow

You don't have to do anything. Just link your card and watch your money grow. 

### Cashing out

You can deposit all the money from Acorns to your bank account at any time.

## Web Browsing

Yes. You're leaving money on the table if you're seeing an ad online but not getting paid for it.

### Apps

Brave - Download the browser and opt-in to ads in the "Brave Rewards" section. There are a lot of reasons to switch to Brave, such as inbuilt ad-blocker, no autoplay and option to block trackers. Moreover it's built on top of Chromium (Chrome's open source project), so you can simply import all your history, bookmarks etc. from Chrome with one click. Almost all of Chrome's extensions also seem to be working in Brave. 

For the payments part, you get paid in Basic Action Token (BAT) - 0.05 BAT per ad and you can get a maximum of 5 ads / hour. Currently 1 BAT is ~$0.34.

### Workflow

Nothing. Just browse the internet as you normally would

### Cashing out

Cashing out is a little tricky here. You can either spend BAT by giving tips to content creators online or register as a content creator (a Twitter account or Youtube channel should suffice) and tip yourself. You can cash out to fiat currency (like $) every month.
